This recipe assumes that a dcm4chee archive 5 server was already set up per the dcm4chee documentation, 
e.g. for running dcm4chee securely with Keycloak in Docker containers.

This recipe further assumes that Keycloak may be run separately from dcm4chee, i.e. that instead of 
starting Keycloak from dcm4chee's docker compose file, keycloak may be running by some other means.
